	<h2>All My Deepest Thoughts</h2>

	<p>
		Yesterday at work I ran into David and he was being a jerk. So later on when we were working on some other things I just ghosted him. 
		This blogging thing is super easy I wonder what else I could add to really make this look as flashy as possible. Maybe a backdrop for 
		the giant empty space of white that I have. Or I could start doing recipes I just have to make the new page for that. Ill just change 
		contact to recipes and leave my information somewhere else! Maybe on the home page instead? This is so much fun!!!! XD
